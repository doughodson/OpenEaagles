Changes since v13.07
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general

# added new aero model called LaeroModel to framework. As a result several
  supporting classes (such as AutoPilot) have been updated to reflect new
  capabilities

# throughout the framework, the listed order of all the objects/variables being
  initialized by constructors has been aligned to match how they are actually
  initialized by the code generated by the compiler.  This change does not impact
  the functionality of the codebase, it merely reduces the number of emitted
  warnings (reorder warning) displayed by recent versions of gcc.

# added an OE version number to "openeaagles/config.h"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic

   Identifier class
      1) Modified to insure a single word (i.e., no spaces); any spaces are
      replaced with underscores.

   String class
      1) Changed the manipulator (set) functions to virtual

#
# Network handler modifications
#

# updated error messages in several of the network handlers.

# created a subdirectory called "nethandlers" that now contains BroadcastHandler,
  MulticastHandler, TcpClient, TcpHandler, TcpServerMultiple, TcpServerSingle,
  and UdpHandler. 

# all subclasses of TcpHandler are now stored in separate files, with filenames
  matching classnames.

   BroadcastHandler class
      1) Filename renamed from BcHandler to BroadcastHandler to match classname

   MulticastHandler class
      1) Filename renamed from McHandler to MulticastHandler to match classname

   TcpServerMultiple class
      1) Renamed class TcpServerMulti to TcpServerMultiple

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basicGL

   Translator class
      1) Fixed copy constructor -- now properly copies all attributes

   Field class
      1) Updated serialize method

dis


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui-glut

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maps

# general cleanup of classes and code (removal of tabs, docs, etc)

   CadrgMap class
      1) fixed a bug in findBestZone() method

recorder


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation

   AutoPilot class
      1) added several new slots that define default pilot flight actions or 
         characteristics, such as the maximum rate of turn, bank angle, max
         climb, etc.  These are pilot characteristics in defining how a plane
         is flown -- not physical performance characteristics associated with
         the vehicle itself.

   AngleOnlyTrackManager class
      1) initialized a few previously uninitialized variables -- the initialization
         didn't matter, but we like to adhere to coding stds.

   DynamicsModels class
      1) set commanded heading, velocity, and altitude now take additional
         parameters to define change rates.

   Radar class
      1) Added check to ensure a track mgr is available to sent reports, before
         doing so (fix)

   RfSensor class
      1) Updated serialize method

   RfSystem class
      1) Updated serialize method

   ScanGimbal class
      1) Updated serialize method

   Simulation class
      1) updateData() -- corrected the delta time being passed to updateBgPlayerList()
         when more than one background thread is being used (bug fix)
      2) updated timing calculations so that a simulation can run very slowly (< 1 Hz)

   Station class
      1) added slots to set the stack size of the default time critical,
      network and background threads.

   TrackManager class
      1) converted several local member function arrays to class member arrays.

   Weapon class
      1) added storage for target velocity data
      2) updated flags to set data logging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vehicle

   JSBSimModel class
      1) interface updated to account for changes in base DynamicsModels class

   RacModel class
      1) interface updated to account for changes in base DynamicsModels class

   LaeroModel class
      1) added new simple, lightweight aero model
