Changes since v13.07
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general

-- added new aero model called LaeroModel to framework. As a result several
   supporting classes (such as AutoPilot) have been updated to reflect new
   capabilities

-- throughout the framework, the listed order of all the objects/variables being
   initialized by constructors has been aligned to match how they are actually
   initialized by the code generated by the compiler.  This change does not impact
   the functionality of the codebase, it merely reduces the number of emitted
   warnings (reorder warning) displayed by recent versions of gcc.

-- added an OE version number to "openeaagles/config.h"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic

-- updated error messages in several of the network handlers.

   BroadcastHandler class
      1) Filename renamed from BcHandler to BroadcastHandler to match classname

   Identifier class
      1) Modified to insure a single word (i.e., no spaces); any spaces are
      replaced with underscores.

   MulticastHandler class
      1) Filename renamed from McHandler to MulticastHandler to match classname

   String class
      1) Changed the manipulator (set) functions to virtual

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maps

-- general cleanup of classes and code (removal of tabs, docs, etc)

   CadrgMap class
      1) fixed a bug in findBestZone() method

simulation

   AutoPilot class
      1) added several new slots that define default pilot flight actions or 
         characteristics, such as the maximum rate of turn, bank angle, max
         climb, etc.  These are pilot characteristics in defining how a plane
         is flown -- not physical performance characteristics associated with
         the vehicle itself.

   AngleOnlyTrackManager class
      1) initialized a few previously uninitialized variables -- the initialization
         didn't matter, but we like to adhere to coding stds.

   DynamicsModels class
      1) set commanded heading, velocity, and altitude now take additional
         parameters to define change rates.

   Simulation class
      1) updateData() -- corrected the delta time being passed to updateBgPlayerList()
         when more than one background thread is being used (bug fix)

   Station class
      1) added slots to set the stack size of the default time critical,
      network and background threads.

   TrackManager class
      1) converted several local member function arrays to class member arrays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vehicle

   JSBSimModel class
      1) interface updated to account for changes in base DynamicsModels class

   RacModel class
      1) interface updated to account for changes in base DynamicsModels class

   LaeroModel class
      1) added new simple, lightweight aero model
