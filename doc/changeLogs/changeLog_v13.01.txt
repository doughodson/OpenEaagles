Changes since v12.09
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general

-- across the board spelling fixes
-- On linux, now compiles Position Independent Code (PIC) by default (see src/makedefs)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic

   linux/lock.h
      1) By default, now using  __sync_lock_test_and_set() and __sync_lock_release()

   Logger class
      1) Added new public functions getFilename(), getPathname() and getTopLine(), and
      moved the set slot function from protected to public
      2) Added new protected functions setOpen() and setFailed()
      3) Moved the output stream to protected.

   Thread classes
      1) Fixed double thread termination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basicGL

   BitmapFont class
      1) Added the degree symbol character (0XB0)
      2) Misc cleanup

   DirectionReadout class
      1) makeText() - now changes '@' to the degree character (0xB0)

   Display class
      1) Fixed a bug associated with readFrameBuffer() returning a
         boolean false, when it should return 0.

   Graphic class
      1) removed the setSlotStipplePattern(String) slot function, which required a hex
      string value.  Use the setSlotStipplePattern(Number) slot function.
      2) setSlotStipplePattern(Number) -- added a 16 bit value check
      3) changed default for slot 'stippleFactor' from zero to one
      4) changed default for slot 'stipplePattern' from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF

   Image class
      1) Updated to read BMP files on Big-endian systems

   NumericReadout class
      1) redisplay() -- added check for the 'postSign' flag (bug fix -- wasn't
      always moving the sign character from the prefix to the suffix position)

   Readout.cpp file
      Rearranged file by class

   StrokeFont class
      1) Added the degree symbol character (0XB0)
      2) Misc cleanup and documentation
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dis

   EmitterBeamData struct
      1) add the check for 'beamStatus', which was missing from the compare '==' operator.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui-glut

   GlutDisplay class
      1) reshapeSubWindow() -- added a glutPostWindowRedisplay() call since the
      glutReshapeWindow() didn't always take on Linux.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
otw

   CigiClNetworkSignalProcessing class
      1) OnHotResp() -- added support for the CigiHatHotXRespV3_2 class.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recorder


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation

   Action class
      1) Is now derived from basic's UBF Action class.  The execute() function
      'actor' argument must be the OnboardComputer or the ownship, which can be
      used to find the OnboardComputer.  The execute() function will find the
      OnboardComputer and 'trigger' the action.

   Antenna class
      1) onRfEmissionEvent() -- created and ref()'d a local copy of the RfSystem
      pointer.  Without this change, the Antenna can remove the 'sys' pointer
      in the middle of this method when a shutdown event occurs.

      2) onRfEmissionReturnEventAntenna() -- created and ref()'d a local copy of
      the RfSystem pointer.  .  Without this change, the Antenna can remove the
      'sys' pointer in the middle of this method when a shutdown event occurs.

   Navigation class
      1) Added an initial route, which is set with the 'route' slot (setSlotRoute()),
      and is used by reset() to reset the route to it's initial input value.

      2) Added setRoute(), which like setSlotRoute(), will set the current route,
      but it does not set the initial route used by reset().

   Route class
      1) insertSteerpoint() -- added an unref() after the steerpoint has been
      inserted into the route, and modified where the original steerpoint list
      is unref()'d (both possible memory leaks)

      2) insertSteerpoint() -- added a ref() to a steerpoint being inserted
      into the middle of the route (bug fix)

      3) insertSteerpoint() -- any steerpoint with its 'pos' greater than the size
      of the list is now added to the end of the list.

      4) In various functions, modified where the steerpoint list is unref()

   Simulation class
      1) reset() -- while generating the new player list, now reinstating the container
      pointer and player name.


   Steerpoint class
      1) setSlotSteerpointType() -- added check for "IP" enum.

   Weapon class
      1) atReleaseInit() -- changed eventID check from not-equal-zero to equal-zero,
      which prevents a possible double increment of the weapon event ID.

      2) Added new setReleaseEventID() function

      3) release() and updateTOF() -- removed the MSG_DATA checks from the data
      recorder samples
