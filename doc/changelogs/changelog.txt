================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General framework-wide changes/improvements

-- Old logger functionality has been removed in favor of binary data recorder
   library.  The classes base::Logger, simulation::SimLogger and simulation::TabLogger
   have been removed.

-- Renamed several of the key classes that are abstract to 'Abstract<<CLASSNAME>>'.
   For example, NetIO in simulation library became 'AbstractNetIO'.  This naming
   convention better indicates the role those classes take in relation to other
   classes.

   Often abstract classes define a small set of functionality, but maybe more
   importantly, they define an interface of importance that is partially defined.
   At this point, there are no classes within the framework that serve as a pure
   interface-only specification -- all usually implement (by default) something.

Modern C++ Improvements (code modernization, enhancements and general improvements)

-- Replaced several found null pointer 0's with nullptr.

-- Now using 'auto' keyword to declare types in a significant way; specifically
   used in places they declare variables that are initialized with rather long and
   obvious type definitions. For example:

   oe::models::Autopilot* ap = dynamic_cast<oe::models::Autopilot*>(av->getPilot());

   can be written as:

   auto ap = dynamic_cast<oe::models::Autopilot*>(av->getPilot());

   and improved upon like this:

   const auto ap = dynamic_cast<oe::models::Autopilot*>(av->getPilot());

   which results in const'ing the pointer variable itself, if appropriate (i.e.,
   oe::models::Autopilot* const ap).

-- Now using in-class brace initializers throughout codebase for member data.
   This C++11 feature improves code clarity, and potentially reduces
   data initalization issues by eliminating multiple redundant variable initializations
   (sometimes by assignment) when several constructors have been defined. This,
   in some cases, eliminates the need for 'initData()' member methods often defined
   to support this initialization activity.

   This also eliminates any possible initalization vs assignment performance issues
   and often reduces the amount of code within the 'copyData' member - specifically,
   it often reduces or completely eliminates code associated copy construction.

-- Now using std::array for all single dimension data array.  This is a zero cost
   abstraction.  At this point, only class data member declarations have been
   changed -- specific use of this template throughout rest of code is to be done.

-- Not really a Modern C++ improvement, but all pragma's associated with turning
   on/off compiler generated warnings have been removed from code.  They are now made
   explicit with command line options to enable/disable (much all -Wall in GCC).

base library (oe_base)

-- Removed original OSG (OpenSceneGraphic) aliased types Vec3, Vec4, Matrix, etc,
   with explicit declarations (e.g., Vec3d, Vec3f, Matrixd, etc) throughout framework.
   Along with this change is the movement of these classes from oe::osg namespace
   to oe::base namespace.  For example, the aliased oe::osg::Vec3 class has moved
   from oe::osg to the namespace and explicitly defined as oe::base::Vec3d.
   Both of these changes improve code readability, as all references within 'base'
   namespace are to the class itself (e.g, Vec3d), and outside the namespace as
   base::Vec3d.  This aligns these classes with all the other 'base' classes.

   It should be noted that base::Matrixd (an original 'osg' class) is different than
   base::Matrix (the homegrown openeaagles matrix class).  At some point these different
   classes that essentially define the same concept should be combined or rectified
   somehow to avoid the obvious question - why do multiple classes that represent
   the same concept exist?

   Some rework of the OSG-based classes (Vec and Matrix) was done to modernize them from
   the standpoint of using current, readily available, standard library functionality (e.g.,
   std::fabs, std::isnan) as opposed to defining new functions that 'wrap' or encapulate
   platform specific workarounds for very old OS's, such as IRIX.

   This decision allowed for the removal of some included C header files, such as
   <math.h> and <limits.h> which reduces global namespace polution - and improves
   the readability of the codebase.  The header file 'Math' was renamed to 'math.hpp'
   to clearly indicate its nature (i.e., it's not a Math class).

-- Extracted constants and conversion methods from within unit classes, such as,
   Angle, Distance, Mass, and placed into individual files.  This better indicates
   that these are 'pure' functions without side effects, simplifies the original classes,
   and makes their usage throughout codebase more clear.  The classes Angle, Mass, etc,
   are 'abstract', but they have not been renamed in anyway to 'AbstractThis' or
   'AbstractThat' to avoid massive changes to existing oe-based programs and their already
   obvious abstractness as indicated by name.

-- Renamed fundamental 'ubf' classes such as Action, Behavior and State to AbsractAction,
   AbstractBehavior and AbstractState to make visible the role they play in defining
   the UBF pattern.

-- Moved and grouped all thread related classes into the subfolder 'concurrent' to make
   more obvious the capability provided.  Along with this is the renaming of classes to
   easy to digest names, such as ThreadPeriodicTask to PeriodicTask to avoid overloading
   of names.

-- Renamed subdirectory 'nethandlers' to 'network' as this better conveys the code it
   contains - namely, component interfaces to network sockets. Also moved NetHandler
   class into this directory.

-- Created subdirectory 'io' to store all IO related classes (e.g., IoData, etc.).  At
   some point these will be moved into iodevice library

   Object class
     -- In Object, the method getSlotByIndex() has been removed.  Therefore any derived
        Object-based classes no longer need to define it.  For legacy code, methods of
        the form below (in all class definitions), should be deleted.

        base::Object* <<CLASSNAME>>::getSlotByIndex(const int si)
        {
           return BaseClass::getSlotByIndex(si);
        }

        This change simplifies the codebase by eliminating unused methods and
        reducing code clutter.

     -- Extracted '_Static' structure (i.e., struct) from Object and moved into a
        standalone class called MetaObject - which is, what it is.  Updated
        Object to use this object (via, a variable called 'metaObject')
        in lue of '_static' to store class and object related information.  This has
        NO impact on API, but does improve code readable.

     -- Removed both registerClass() and WriteClassList() methods and underlying
        support structure to maintain a list of classes compiled into an application.
        This was used so that a developer could print a list of classes
        available within an application and metadata related to them,
        such as the number of instances currently in existance.

        In theory, this information could be used to help debug memory leaks within
        a running application. Not only can this capability be replicated outside of
        Object itself, other tools exist (e.g., Valgrind) which are much more
        comprehensive for this purpose. Removing the code associated with this functionality
        greatly simplifies Object, its associated macros, and instance creation.
        It also reduces the barrier to understanding what the code is doing.

     -- Removed Object::getClassName() method - never used, available in MetaObject.

   Nav class (removed)
     -- This class contained only static methods, so it was restructured as a set
        of functions within the oe::base::nav namespace defined in file 'util/nav_utils.hpp'.

   NavDR class (removed)
     -- This class contained only static methods, so it was restructured as a set
        of functions within the oe::base::navDR namespace defined in file 'util/navDR_utils.hpp'.

   MetaObject
     -- New class that replaces _Static class once defined in Object.

     -- Added getClassName() and getFactoryName() to this newly defined class.
        The intent was to move all 'meta' information about class and object instances
        away from Object itself, and into this class.

   Component class
     -- Component-based data logger functionality has been removed.  Removal of
        this rippled into simulation library with the deletion of SimLogger and
        TabLogger classes.

   SlotTable class
     -- Removed useless methods such as copyData, deleteData -- probably remnant
        methods from long ago, when this might have been an Object-based class.

     -- Deleted copy and assignment operators

   safe_ptr template
     -- Fixed the assignment operators.  This bug has existed for years, but probably
        noticed or 'discovered' because nobody writes code like this x = x;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation library (oe_simulation)

-- Created mostly abstract interface classes for NetIO, Otw and Player.  The
   relationship between these classes serve as the defining architecture for
   simulation applications.  It also draws a clear line between the infrastructure
   needed to execute a simulation and the models being processed.

-- Moved all models into respective libraries -- models, terrain, otw.
   The goal was to divorce, simplify, and focus the contents of this
   library to defining the basic architecture of a simulation.  It is now much
   less concerned about models and interoperability interfaces.
   In domain driven design (DDD) literature, this is called refactoring a ball
   of mud into more clear boundary contexts. In other words, it simplifies
   understanding and improves clarity.

   Otm class
      -- Renamed 'formName' slot to 'factoryName' to align code with existing
         framework termionology.

   AbstractPlayer
      -- Removed two undefined methods "isSmoothing()" and "getSmoothingRate()".
         Both were undefined and not used.

   Simulation class
     -- This class serves as the connection between the execution infrastructure
        to update players within a simulated world, and a model of that world.
        This division of responsibilities is now more explicit by keeping all
        infrastructure related activites, such as, multi-threaded Player execution
        mechanics away from modeling the world itself.  The world being modeled
        is defined by a new class (i.e., WorldModel), that resides in the models
        library.

     -- At the moment, a WorldModel is a subclass of a simulation - existing EDL
        files need to be updated by replacing "Simulation" references to
        "WorldModel".

     -- It is recoginized that by subclassing, there still remains a close coupling
        between these two different aspects (models and simulation execution).  But,
        even though not optimal, it is a step in the right direction to decouple
        this relationship.  At some point, the relationship between the simulation
        execution infrastructure and a world model will probably become an aggregate
        (i.e., a simulation owns a model to be executed.)

models library (oe_models)

-- Moved all players, systems and component-based models from simulation library
   into this library.

-- Grouped somewhat obvious highly related models into subfolders within the models
   library.  This includes folders called player, system, dynamics, environment,
   navigation, etc.  This can be improved, but it's a good start.

-- Removed NavRadio-based classes: NavRadio, IlsRadio and TacanRadio.  These classes
   used DAFIF data to navigate to airports and navaids.  In the real world, this
   capability can also be used to land an aircraft through instrumentation.  The models
   as designed can not do a full landing, but can navigate to a location.  They
   have been moved into the testDafif example to retain the code and show how to extend
   a world model to include DAFIF data.

   WorldModel (new class)
      -- Contains the guts of what used to be in Simulation class concerning
         the modeled world -- class does not contain any code related to
         execution of players, etc.
