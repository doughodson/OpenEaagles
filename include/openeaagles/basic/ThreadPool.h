// Class: ThreadPool
//
// Description:
//    General purpose thread pool. You should pass in a ThreadPoolManager
//    derivative to provide the logic for different stages of threaded
//    operation (such as thread initialization or execution). Separating
//    the callbacks from the ThreadPool class keeps the ThreadPool itself
//    completely generic. It can be used programmatically or as part of
//    a Component, and the number of threads to use as well as their
//    priority are configurable and slottable. Selecting 0 for the number
//    of threads puts the ThreadPool in single-threaded mode. This will
//    still operate as if threads were being used except all calls (such
//    as execute()) will block the caller until completed.
//
// Possible improvements:
// - Provide another slot/variable to specify a wait timeout while waiting for
//   a thread to free from the pool. If the wait is exceeded, could continue
//   without executing, or even better, execute a timeout() callback in the
//   manager class to handle timeouts.
