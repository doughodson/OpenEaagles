// Map page is actually not derived from an instrument, but it acts as a simple way to draw tacans, waypoints, and other nav data on a page, using
// lat longs and such to determine screen position.  Map page also tells all of its components which are map pages what its reference lat and lon is, what the
// range is, displacement, and any other pertinent information (see MapPage.cpp, and .h).  This is very similar to instrument in the fact that it eliminates
