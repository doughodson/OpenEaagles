This is the Maps library

1) RPF (Raster Product Format)
    - This library contains classes that can read and draw the CADRG RPF format.
      All that is needed is the A.TOC file and associated map data.
    
For more information on how to setup the RPF library in an application (using
Eaagles Description Language (.edl)), please see CadrgMap.h
